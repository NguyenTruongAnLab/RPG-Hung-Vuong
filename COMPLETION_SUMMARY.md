## 🏛️ The Four Architectural Commandments

Your updated instructions now enforce **4 critical rules** that AI agents must follow:

### 1. **The 500-Line Law** (ABSOLUTE)
- NO file shall exceed 500 lines
- Target: <400 lines per file
- Enforcement: `wc -l filename.ts` before every commit
- Split examples provided

### 2. **Use Popular Libraries** (MANDATORY)
- **Matter.js** for physics
- **GSAP** for animations
- **@pixi/tilemap** for tilemaps
- **Lodash** for utilities
- NO custom implementations where libraries exist

### 3. **Extreme Modularity** (REQUIRED)
- Composition over inheritance
- Component-based entities
- One responsibility per file
- Every folder has README.md

### 4. **Documentation = AI Success** (ESSENTIAL)
- JSDoc with @example for all public methods
- Inline comments explain WHY, not WHAT
- Folder README.md files explain architecture
