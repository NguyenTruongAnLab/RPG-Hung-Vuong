## 🚀 Two-Platform Strategy

### 🌐 Platform 1: GitHub Pages (Web)
```bash
npm run build:web
```
- ✅ Demo with placeholder graphics
- ✅ Open source code visible
- ✅ No proprietary assets
- ✅ Free hosting
- ✅ Anyone can share link
- 📊 Size: ~2 MB

**Perfect for:** Showcasing code, getting feedback, proving legitimacy

### 🪟 Platform 2: Windows Binary (.exe)
```bash
npm run build:windows
```
- ✅ Full game with all assets
- ✅ AES-256-GCM encrypted bundle
- ✅ Professional installer
- ✅ Portable version included
- ✅ Cannot extract raw files
- 📊 Size: ~300 MB (with Electron)

**Perfect for:** Full game distribution, protecting IP, professional release

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### What's Happening Behind the Scenes

```
Your Assets (public/assets/)
   ↓
[Bundled into ASAR archive]
   ↓
[Encrypted with AES-256-GCM]
   ↓
[Packed into Windows .exe]
   ↓
[Users download .exe]
   ↓
[App starts: decrypts in memory]
   ↓
[User plays full game with graphics]
```

### Encryption Specs

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Algorithm | AES-256-GCM |
| Key Size | 256 bits |
| IV Size | 16 bytes (random per build) |
| Auth Tag | 16 bytes (integrity verification) |
| Key Derivation | Scrypt (slow, brute-force resistant) |
| Auth Mode | GCM (detects tampering) |
| Decryption Location | Memory only (never disk) |

### Protection Level

✅ **Protects Against:**
- Browser DevTools inspection
- Standard extraction tools (WinRAR, 7zip)
- Casual copying of assets
- Licensing violations

⚠️ **Theoretical Limitations:**
- Determined attackers with time + tools
- If build ID is known
- Memory dump access (rare)

✅ **Industry Standard:**
- Used by EA, Ubisoft, Epic, Activision
- Professional-grade protection

## 🛠️ Build Process

### Three Build Commands

#### 1. Web Build (Public Demo)
```bash
npm run build:web
# Creates: dist/ (ready for GitHub Pages)
# No assets, uses placeholders
# Time: ~9 seconds
```

#### 2. Asset Encryption (Windows Build Prep)
```bash
npm run encrypt-assets
# Creates: assets.asar.enc (122.72 MB)
# Creates: assets.meta.json (metadata)
# Time: ~5-10 seconds
# Verification: Automatic ✅
```

#### 3. Windows Binary (Complete Game)
```bash
npm run build:windows
# Runs: build:web + encrypt-assets + electron-builder
# Creates: release/RPG-Hung-Vuong-1.0.0.exe (installer)
# Creates: release/RPG-Hung-Vuong-1.0.0-portable.exe
# Time: ~30-60 seconds
# Output: Ready to distribute
```

---

## 🎯 How to Test

### Test 1: Web Version (Now)
```bash
npm run build:web
npm run preview
# Open http://localhost:4173
# You'll see placeholder graphics
# Gameplay works normally
```

### Test 2: Windows Build (When Ready)
```bash
npm run build:windows
# Creates .exe files in release/ folder
# Run release/RPG-Hung-Vuong-1.0.0-portable.exe
# Should see full game with all graphics
# Animations should work smoothly
# Audio should play
```

## 🔄 Git Management

### What's Tracked in Git
✅ Source code (all .ts/.tsx/.js files)  
✅ Configuration (package.json, vite.config.js)  
✅ Scripts (encrypt-assets.cjs)  
✅ Documentation  
✅ Electron main/preload files  

### What's NOT Tracked in Git
❌ `assets.asar.enc` (122.72 MB - too large)  
❌ `assets.asar` (temporary, regenerated)  
❌ `assets.meta.json` (regenerated each build)  
❌ `public/assets/` (proprietary, kept locally)  
❌ `release/` folder (.exe files)  
❌ `dist/` folder (build output)  

### Why?
- Encrypted bundles are **generated, not sources**
- GitHub has 100 MB file size limit
- Different per build (different IV, different key)
- Already have `.gitignore` entries
