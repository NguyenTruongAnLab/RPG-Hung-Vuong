## 🔧 Fixes Applied

1. **Exposed Game Systems for Debugging**
   ```typescript
   window.app = app;
   window.sceneManager = sceneManager;
   window.scene = overworldScene;
   window.PhysicsManager = PhysicsManager;
   window.InputManager = InputManager;
   window.EventBus = EventBus;
   ```

2. **Added Battle Logging**
   - Turn counter logging
   - Damage calculation logging
   - Battle end state logging
   - Transition step logging

3. **Fixed Test Configuration**
   - Excluded E2E tests from vitest
   - Added test-results to .gitignore
   - Proper test separation

## ⚠️ Known Non-Critical Issues

1. **DragonBones Animation Warnings**
   - Message: "Cannot play animation: armature display not set"
   - Occurrences: ~41 times
   - Impact: Cosmetic only (using placeholder graphics)
   - Fix: Will be resolved when DragonBones assets added

2. **Matter.js Delta Warning**
   - Message: "delta argument is recommended to be less than or equal to 16.667 ms"
   - Impact: May cause jitter on slow frames
   - Status: Not affecting current gameplay

3. **WebGL Browser Warnings**
   - Playwright-specific (headless browser)
   - Does not occur in real browsers
   - No impact on functionality

## 🚀 How to Run & Test

### Start the Game
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000/demo.html
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Test Movement**
   - Press WASD or Arrow keys
   - Player should move smoothly
   - Cannot pass through walls

2. **Test Battle (Console)**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   EventBus.getInstance().emit('encounter:trigger', { zone: 'test' });
   
   // Watch for:
   // - Fade out
   // - Battle scene loads
   // - Auto-battle executes
   // - Victory after ~10 seconds
   // - Fade back to overworld
   ```

3. **Check Game State**
   ```javascript
   // Check systems
   console.log('Physics bodies:', PhysicsManager.getInstance().getWorld().bodies.length);
   // Expected: 41
   
   // Check player
   const player = PhysicsManager.getInstance().getWorld().bodies.find(b => b.label === 'player');
   console.log('Player:', player.position);
   // Expected: { x: 320, y: 240 }
   ```

### Run E2E Tests
```bash
# Run specific test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/battle-test.spec.ts

# Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/
```
