## ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Project Vision** (New)
- Clear description of Pokemon-style dual-mode gameplay
- Overworld (real-time, Matter.js physics) + Battle (turn-based)
- Technology stack clearly defined
- Visual game flow diagram

### 2. **Architectural Commandments** (New)
Four critical rules that AI agents MUST follow:

#### Commandment 1: The 500-Line Law
- **ABSOLUTE RULE**: No file shall exceed 500 lines
- Target: <400 lines per file
- Enforcement: Check with `wc -l filename.ts` before every commit
- Examples of how to split large files

#### Commandment 2: Use Popular Libraries
- **Matter.js** for physics (NOT custom physics)
- **GSAP** for animations (NOT custom animation engines)
- **@pixi/tilemap** for tilemaps (NOT custom renderers)
- **Lodash** for utilities
- Rationale: AI already trained on these libraries

#### Commandment 3: Extreme Modularity
- Composition over inheritance pattern
- Component-based entities
- One responsibility per file
- Code examples provided

#### Commandment 4: Documentation = AI Success
- Every folder has README.md
- JSDoc with @example for all public methods
- Inline comments explain WHY, not WHAT

### 3. **Game Architecture** (Enhanced)
- Detailed dual-mode system diagram
- Overworld Mode specifications (Matter.js, real-time)
- Battle Mode specifications (turn-based, existing)
- Technology stack with rationale

### 4. **Complete Directory Structure** (New)
- Target state directory tree
- Line count limits for each folder
- Purpose of each directory explained
- 200+ file organization

### 5. **Phase 2 Implementation Guide** (New)
Detailed guide for Pokemon-style overworld:
- Library installation commands
- Implementation order (Week 2-3)
- Code examples for:
  - PhysicsManager with Matter.js
  - Camera follow with GSAP
  - Tilemap rendering with @pixi/tilemap
- File size targets for each component

### 6. **Enhanced Testing Requirements** (Major Update)
- **Testing Philosophy**: Test public API, not implementation
- Good vs Bad test examples
- Minimum test count by file size
- E2E test examples with Playwright
- Pre-commit testing checklist

### 7. **Expanded Coding Style** (Enhanced)
- TypeScript best practices
- Comprehensive naming conventions
- JSDoc examples with @example tags
- Comment guidelines (explain WHY)
- Complete code example with all patterns

### 8. **Deployment & CI/CD** (Enhanced)
- GitHub Pages deployment process
- CI/CD pipeline explained
- Build configuration examples
- Performance targets table

### 9. **Commit Message Format** (Enhanced)
- Conventional Commits format
- Multiple examples for each type
- Special formats for file splitting
- Library integration commits

### 10. **Collaboration Rules** (Major Update)
- Before/during/after work checklists
- Mandatory pre-commit checklist
- Code review self-checklist
- Step-by-step workflow

### 11. **Debugging Tips** (New)
- Build failure troubleshooting
- Test debugging steps
- Game runtime issues
- Performance profiling
- Common fixes

### 12. **Resources** (Enhanced)
- Official documentation links
- Tools & editors
- Vietnamese game dev guidelines
- Learning resources

### 13. **Final Checklist** (New)
Complete checklist before marking any task complete:
- Code quality checks
- Testing requirements
- Documentation updates
- Build verification
- Git best practices

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Developers

### For Human Developers:
1. Read the updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. Review the Architectural Commandments
3. Check `docs/PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed steps
4. Start with library installation: `npm install matter-js gsap @pixi/tilemap`

### For AI Agents:
1. Always read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` before starting work
2. Follow the 500-line law strictly
3. Use popular libraries (Matter.js, GSAP, @pixi/tilemap)
4. Test public API only
5. Complete final checklist before marking task done
